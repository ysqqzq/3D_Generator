# 3D Data Visualization Tool

This repository hosts a 3D data visualization tool developed using Streamlit and Plotly. The application provides interactive 3D plots that can be customized and visualized directly in the browser. Designed for data analysis and visualization, this tool is particularly useful for understanding the relationships among multiple dimensions in a dataset.

## Features

- **3D Scatter Plot**: Visualize data points in a 3D space with adjustable group selection.
- **3D Mesh Plot with Points**: Display a 3D mesh representation of the data alongside individual data points for added detail.
- **Contour Plot with Points**: Generate a 2D contour plot overlaid with data points to visualize density or variations in a specific plane.

## Usage

1. **Select Groups**: Choose the groups of data you wish to visualize.
2. **Choose Plot Type**: Select the type of 3D plot you want to generate.
3. **Generate Plot**: Click the "Generate Plot" button to create the selected 3D plot in real-time.

## Deployment

The tool is deployed using Streamlit Cloud, allowing it to run directly in the browser. Access the live application [here]([https://your-username-streamlit-cloud-link](https://3dgenerator-tytwenoyorbmupsp6scjnb.streamlit.app/)).
